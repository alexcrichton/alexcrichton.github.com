<h1>A New World Order</h1>
<p>
  Despite Wilson’s relentless efforts, the United States never did ratify the Treaty of Versailles
  until 1921, when it was amended for the US to opt out of the League of Nations. Wilson fervently
  believed the Covenant must not be altered for the League to have any effect when subduing a nation’s
  “passions” and preventing future wars. He would not stand for a compromise. When Senator Lodge
  amended the treaty, Wilson instructed his supporters to vote against it and it failed.
</p>
<p>
  While the US never became a full member of the League of Nations, there were numerous
  states that did. The <a href="sources/membership.html">list of members</a> ranged from Canada to China to Venezuela
  and Japan. In accordance
  to Wilson’s vision, the League of Nations provided a forum for nations to voice their opinions as equals
  and resolve disputes without resorting to force. Between 1920 and 1925, the League was able to resolve
  a <a href="sources/finswed.html">border dispute</a> between Finland and Sweden – skirting a possible
  war. In 1922, the League saved
  Austria from <a href="sources/austria.html">economic collapse</a>. Smaller nations, such as Albania, saw
  the League as a means to voice
  their <a href="sources/albania.html">grievances</a> without fear of retaliation. However, the League
  had its weaknesses. It lacked the
  power to enforce controversial decisions and it was further handicapped by the failure of the United
  States to join. Nazi Germany withdrew from the League in 1933. With the onset of World War II, the
  League had become marginalized to the point where any meaningful diplomacy only conducted at the
  bilateral level. It effectively ceased to function during and after World War II until it was formally
  dissolved by the formation of the Charter of the <a href="sources/united_nations.html">United Nations</a>.
</p>
<p>
  While the League of Nations ultimately failed, it was an invaluable experiment in the realm of
  international relations. It opened the door for a new genre of diplomacy that could be used to bring the
  world closer to peace. The League of Nations, with both its strengths and failures, provided a model for
  the consequent United Nations. The United Nations which plays an integral peacekeeping role in the
  world today was made stronger because it avoided the mistakes of the League of Nations. Without the
  perseverance of President Woodrow Wilson, the concept of a united body of all nations would not be
  common knowledge today, and the world would have been one step further from peace.
