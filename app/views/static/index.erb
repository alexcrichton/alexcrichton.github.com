<h2 class="separator">Welcome</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to my personal website about my coding. I have recently started this project and am attempting to add a record
  of what I have coded onto this website to keep a clean organized record of what I've done.<br />
  <em>More coming soon...</em> (most likely this will be here forever)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How did I make this website?</strong><br/>
  As for the actual code, thank Rails for that. Templates, can't beat them. But you see no trace of rails? Why the
  <code>.html</code> extension for the pages? Magic? Sadly, just a linux script to convert all these static pages from
  rails to their HTML pages, then served up directly. Our poor server is running enough Rails apps already...
</p>
