<h1>The War at Home</h1>
<p>Woodrow Wilson worked hard to push the League of Nations and the rest of the Fourteen
  Points to the top of the agenda at Versailles. He was not able to incorporate all of his points into the
  treaty but was able to push the League of Nations to the forefront of the final draft of the Treaty of
  Versailles. The first 26 of the treaty’s 440 articles formed the
  <a href="sources/covenant.html">Covenant of the League</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The crux of the Covenant was <a href="sources/covenant.html#10">Article 10</a> which obligates member states to
  “respect
  and
  preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all
  Members of the League.” Article 10 and <a href="sources/covenant.html#11">Article 11</a> encompassed an international
  collective security. This
  naturally gave rise to as much opposition as support from the countries involved. Smaller states
  advocated the Covenant, recognizing the benefits of a mutual alliance with world powers. Polish Prime
  <a href="sources/paderewski.html">Minister Ignace Paderewski</a> stated:
<blockquote>
  Unless we have a protective power in the world, under whose strength we can secure an
  opportunity for peaceful development and the solution of our internal problems, free from
  distracting and antagonistic influences, I fear for the safety of our democracy.<br />
  The great power and the support which it may furnish need not be military, its moral and
  economic force is all that we ask, and that power is the League of Nations.
</blockquote>
Others saw the League in a different. In the United States, Wilson faced significant opposition led by
<a href="sources/cabot.html">Senator Henry Cabot
  Lodge</a>. Senator Lodge was a staunch Republican who believed that Article 10 of the
covenant amounted to a cession of sovereignty from the United States, declaring:
<blockquote>
  We have been devoted to the cause of freedom, humanity, and civilization everywhere. Now we
  are asked, in the making of peace, to sacrifice our sovereignty in important respects, to involve
  ourselves almost without limit in the affairs of other nations and to yield up policies and rights
  which we have maintained throughout our history.
</blockquote>
He interpreted the clause as a possible requirement for the United States to commit economic or
military force in order to preserve the collective security of the member states. He viewed as an
obligation as intolerable:
<blockquote>
  In what I have already said about other nations putting us into war I have covered one point of
  sovereignty which ought never to be yielded—the power to send American soldiers and sailors
  everywhere, which ought never to be taken from the American people or impaired in the
  slightest degree. Let us beware how we palter with our independence. We have not reached the
  great position from which we were able to come down into the field of battle and help to save
  the world from tyranny by being guided by others. Our vast power has all been built up and
  gathered together by ourselves alone.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Having authored Article 10, Wilson <a href="sources/wilson-defends.html">vehemently defended</a> the League and the
  rest of the
  Covenant. He maintained that the United States had the ability to veto any resolution from the League
  which it objected. Realizing that the League of Nations was a
  <a href="sources/lodge.html">key point of contention</a> for the Senate
  ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson embarked upon a tour of the nation to garner support for
  the Covenant. Traveling 9,981, Wilson gave speeches in 29 cities for his dream of a new international
  order. In his <a href="sources/final.html">last speech at Pueblo, Colorado</a> on September 25th, 1919, Wilson
  affirmed the League of
  Nations as crucial step towards world peace:
<blockquote>
  You will say, “Is the League and absolute guaranty against war?” No; I do not know any absolute
  guaranty against the errors of human judgment or the violence of human passion…I ask you this:
  If it is not an absolute insurance against war, do you want no insurance at all? Do you want
  nothing? Do you want not only no probability that war will not recur, but the probability that it
  will recur? The arrangements of justice of not stand of themselves, my fellow citizens. The
  arrangements of this treaty are just, but they need the support of the combined power of the
  great nations of the world.
</blockquote>
Shortly after delivering these words to the crowd at Pueblo, Colorado, President Wilson collapsed. He
had worked himself to exhaustion while fighting for his cause. Disregarding his own health, Wilson
refused to stand by and allow the atrocities of WWI to recur. He later suffered a stroke that paralyzed
half of his body and isolated him for the rest of his presidency.
