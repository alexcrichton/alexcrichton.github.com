<h1>A New World Order</h1>
<p>
  While partisanship and perhaps stubbornness prevented the United States from becoming a full member of the League,
  other nations embraced it. Wilson’s dream became reality for countries ranging ranged from Canada to China to
  Venezuela and Japan. The League of Nations provided a forum for nations to voice their opinions as equals and resolve
  disputes without resorting to force. Between 1920 and 1925, the League was able to resolve a
  <a href="sources/finswed.html">border dispute</a> between Finland and Sweden – skirting a possible war. In 1922, the
  League saved Austria from <a href="sources/austria.html">economic collapse</a>. Smaller nations, such as Albania, saw
  the League as a means to voice their <a href="sources/albania.html">grievances</a> without fear of retaliation. This
  new medium for international cooperation was Wilson’s legacy to the world.
<p>
  However, the League had its weaknesses. It lacked sufficient power to enforce controversial decisions, especially when
  it lacked the backing of the United States as a considerable world power. The Allies were not much help in matters
  that were against their interest. Circumstances in the 1930s such as the Great Depression made countries increasingly
  more nationalistic and protective. The liability was the imperialist ambitions of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Nazi
  Germany withdrew from the League in 1933, followed by Italy and Japan. With the onset of World War II, the League
  became marginalized to the point where any meaningful diplomacy was only conducted at the bilateral level.  It
  effectively ceased to function during and after World War II until it was formally dissolved by the Charter of the
  United Nations.
</p>

<p>
  While the League of Nations ultimately failed, it was an invaluable experiment in the realm of international
  relations. It opened the door for a new genre of diplomacy that could be used to bring the world closer to peace. With
  both its strengths and failures, the League provided a model for the consequent United Nations, which derives a large
  part of its current structure from its predecessor. The United Nations is able to play an integral peacekeeping role
  in the world today by avoiding the mistakes of the League of Nations. Without the perseverance of President Woodrow
  Wilson, the concept of a united body of all nations would not be common knowledge today. His legacy brought the world
  one step closer to peace.
