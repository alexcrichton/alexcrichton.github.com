<h1>The Fourteenth Point</h1>
<p>
  Traditional warfare took on a new fearful dimension in 1914. Witnessing destruction at a
  massive scale, those at home watched with horror as the number of deaths worldwide steadily rose to 8
  million and more. The armistice announced on 1918 brought an end to the fighting in the trenches, but
  the war moved into the royal palace of Versailles as the Allied Powers wrestled with the terms for a
  peace settlement. The phrase “never again” reverberated in the thoughts of those present, but was
  most keenly heeded by President Woodrow Wilson of the United States. Wilson was acutely aware of
  the bankruptcy of diplomacy and opaque treaties which led to the war. He envisioned an “association of
  nations” dedicated to nonviolent resolution of international conflicts and the principle a nation’s
  entitlement to self-determination. Woodrow Wilson’s struggle to establish a League of Nations
  revolutionized international diplomacy and laid the framework for international cooperation.

<p>
  In January of 1919, President Wilson arrived at Versailles with a vision for peace which he had
  introduced to Congress a year earlier. In his famous
  <a href="sources/fourteen_points_speech.html">Fourteen Points</a> speech to Congress, Wilson
  outlined general principles for setting postwar boundaries and international conduct in a series of
  points. At Versailles, Wilson was most anxious to implement the fourteenth point of his speech:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
  A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of
  affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small
  states alike.
</blockquote>
Wilson’s call for a League of Nations was the first of its kind. Wilson aimed to prevent future global
conflicts by bringing the nations of the world together in a single body where each had equal say and
respect. In a world of power politics and international distrust, the League of Nations would prove to be
the most controversial aspect of the Treaty of Versailles. Yet, Wilson tirelessly pursued his new
mechanism for world peace despite the opposition at home and abroad.
