<h1>The Fourteenth Point</h1>
<p>
  Traditional warfare took on a new fearful dimension in 1914. Two factions of countries, caught in a network of
  alliances, fought over territory with the world as their battleground. The sheer scale of the destruction shocked the
  world. The resulting death toll would weigh heavily on President Woodrow Wilson’s conscience as he made the somber
  decision to declare war on Germany. At the same time, he sought an end to the status quo of world anarchy. Wilson was
  acutely aware of the bankruptcy of diplomacy and opaque treaties which led to the war. He sensed that the same
  alliances which precipitated World War I could serve nobler purpose. Wilson envisioned an “association of nations”
  dedicated to nonviolent resolution of international conflicts and the principle of a nation’s entitlement to
  self-determination. His struggle to establish a League of Nations revolutionized international diplomacy and laid the
  framework for international cooperation.
</p>

<p>
  In January of 1919, President Wilson arrived at Versailles with a vision for peace which he had introduced to Congress
  a year earlier. In his famous
  <a href="sources/fourteen_points_speech.html">Fourteen Points</a> speech to Congress, Wilson outlined general
  principles for setting postwar boundaries and international conduct in a series of points. At Versailles, Wilson was
  most anxious to implement the fourteenth point of his speech:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual
    guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Wilson aimed to prevent future global conflicts by bringing the nations of the world together in a single body where
  each had equal say and respect. In a world of power politics and international distrust, the League of Nations would
  prove to be the most controversial aspect of the Treaty of Versailles. Yet, Wilson tirelessly pursued his new
  mechanism for world peace despite the opposition at home and abroad.
