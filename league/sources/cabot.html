      <h1>The League of Nations Must Be Revised (1919)</h1>
<h3>Henry Cabot Lodge</h3>
<p>For ourselves we asked absolutely nothing. We have not asked any government or governments to
  guarantee our boundaries or our political independence. We have no fear in regard to either. We have
  sought no territory, no privileges, no advantages, for ourselves. That is the fact. It is apparent on the
  face of the treaty. I do not mean to reflect upon a single one of the powers with which we have been
  associated in the war against Germany, but there is not one of them which has not sought individual
  advantages for their own national benefit. I do not criticize their desires at all. The services and sacrifices
  of England and France and Belgium and Italy are beyond estimate and beyond praise. I am glad they
  should have what they desire for their own welfare and safety. But they all receive under the peace
  territorial and commercial benefits. We are asked to give, and we in no way seek to take. Surely it is not
  too much to insist that when we are offered nothing but the opportunity to give and to aid others we
  should have the right to say what sacrifices we shall make and what the magnitude of our gifts shall be.
  In the prosecution of the war we have unstintedly given American lives and American treasure. When
  the war closed we had 3,000,000 men under arms. We were turning the country into a vast workshop
  for war. We advanced ten billions to our allies. We refused no assistance that we could possibly render.
  All the great energy and power of the Republic were put at the service of the good cause. We have not
  been ungenerous. We have been devoted to the cause of freedom, humanity, and civilization
  everywhere. Now we are asked, in the making of peace, to sacrifice our sovereignty in important
  respects, to involve ourselves almost without limit in the affairs of other nations and to yield up policies
  and rights which we have maintained throughout our history. We are asked to incur liabilities to an
  unlimited extent and furnish assets at the same time which no man can measure. I think it is not only
  our right but our duty to determine how far we shall go. Not only must we look carefully to see where
  we are being led into endless disputes and entanglements, but we must not forget that we have in this
  country millions of people of foreign birth and parentage.
</p>
<p>
  Our one great object is to make all these people Americans so that we may call on them to place
  America first and serve America as they have done in the war just closed. We can not Americanize them
  if we are continually thrusting them back into the quarrels and difficulties of the countries from which
  they came to us. We shall fill this land with political disputes about the troubles and quarrels of other
  countries. We shall have a large portion of our people voting not on American questions and not on
  what concerns the United States but dividing on issues which concern foreign countries alone. That is an
  unwholesome and perilous condition to force upon this country. We must avoid it. We ought to reduce
  to the lowest possible point the foreign questions in which we involve ourselves. Never forget that this
  league is primarily—I might say overwhelmingly—a political organization, and I object strongly to having
  the policies of the United States turn upon disputes where deep feeling is aroused but in which we have
  no direct interest. It will all tend to delay the Americanization of our great population, and it is more
  important not only to the United States but to the peace of the world to make all these people good
  Americans than it is to determine that some piece of territory should belong to one European country
  rather than to another. For this reason I wish to limit strictly our interference in the affairs of Europe and
  of Africa. We have interests of our own in Asia and in the Pacific which we must guard upon our own
  account, but the less we undertake to play the part of umpire and thrust ourselves into European
  conflicts the better for the United States and for the world.
</p>
<p>
  It has been reiterated here on this floor, and reiterated to the point of weariness, that in every treaty
  there is some sacrifice of sovereignty we are justified in sacrificing. In what I have already said about
  other nations putting us into war I have covered one point of sovereignty which ought never to be
  yielded—the power to send American soldiers and sailors everywhere, which ought never to be taken
  from the American people or impaired in the slightest degree. Let us beware how we palter with our
  independence. We have not reached the great position from which we were able to come down into the
  field of battle and help to save the world from tyranny by being guided by others. Our vast power has all
  been built up and gathered together by ourselves alone. We forced our way upward from the days of
  the Revolution, through a world often hostile and always indifferent. We owe no debt to anyone except
  to France in that Revolution, and those policies and those rights on which our power has been founded
  should never be lessened or weakened. It will be no service to the world to do so and it will be of
  intolerable injury to the United States. We will do our share. We are ready and anxious to help in all
  ways to preserve the world's peace. But we can do it best by not crippling ourselves. . . .
</p>
<p>. . . I am thinking of what is best for the world, for if the United States fails the best hopes of mankind
  fail with it. I have never had but one allegiance—I can not divide it now. I have loved but one flag and I
  can not share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented by a league.
  Internationalism, illustrated by the Bolshevik and by the man to whom all countries are alike provided
  they can make money out of them, is to me repulsive. National I must remain, and in that way I like all
  other Americans can render the amplest service to the world. The United States is the world's best
  hope, but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues
  of Europe, you will destroy her power for good and endanger her very existence. . . .
</p>
<p>We are told that we shall "break the heart of the world" if we do not take this league just as it stands. I
  fear that the hearts of the vast majority of mankind would beat on strongly and steadily and without any
  quickening if the league were to perish altogether. . . .
</p>
<p>No doubt many excellent and patriotic people see a coming fulfillment of noble ideals in the word
  "League for Peace." We all respect and share these aspirations and desires, but some of us see no hope,
  but rather defeat, for them in this murky covenant. For we, too, have our ideals, even if we differ from
  those who have tried to establish a monopoly of idealism. Out first ideal is our country, and we see her
  in the future, as in the past, giving service to all her people and to the world. Our ideal of the future is
  that she should continue to render that service of her own free will. She has great problems of her own
  to solve, very grim and perilous problems, and a right solution, if we can attain to it, would largely
  benefit mankind. We would have our country strong to resist a peril from the West, as she has flung
  back the German menace from the East. We would not have our politics distracted and embittered by
  the dissensions of other lands. We would not have our country's vigor exhausted, or her moral force
  abated, by everlasting meddling and muddling in every quarrel, great and small, which afflicts the world.
  Our ideal is to make her ever stronger and better and finer because in that way alone, as we believe, can
  she be of the greatest service to the world's peace and to the welfare of mankind.
