      <h1>Wilson's Fourteen Point Speech</h1>
<p>
  Gentlemen of the Congress...
</p>
<p>
  It will be our wish and purpose that the processes of peace, when they are begun, shall be absolutely
  open and that they shall involve and permit henceforth no secret understandings of any kind. The day
  of conquest and aggrandizement is gone by; so is also the day of secret covenants entered into in the
  interest of particular governments and likely at some unlooked-for moment to upset the peace of the
  world.
</p>
<p>It is this happy fact, now clear to the view of every public man whose thoughts do not still linger in an
  age that is dead and gone, which makes it possible for every nation whose purposes are consistent with
  justice and the peace of the world to avow now or at any other time the objects it has in view.
</p>
<p>We entered this war because violations of right had occurred which touched us to the quick and made
  the life of our own people impossible unless they were corrected and the world secured once for all
  against their recurrence. What we demand in this war, therefore, is nothing peculiar to ourselves.
</p>
<p>It is that the world be made fit and safe to live in; and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-
  loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine its own institutions, be assured
  of justice and fair dealing by the other peoples of the world as against force and selfish aggression. All
  the peoples of the world are in effect partners in this interest, and for our own part we see very clearly
  that unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us. The program of the world's peace,
  therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, as we see it, is this:
</p>
<ol class="roman">
  <li>Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international
    understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view.
  </li>
  <li> Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war,
    except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of
    international covenants.
  </li>
  <li> The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade
    conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its
    maintenance.
  </li>
  <li>Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point
    consistent with domestic safety.
  </li>
  <li>A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict
    observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the
    populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title
    is to be determined.
  </li>
  <li>The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will
    secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an
    unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political
    development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations
    under institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that
    she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the
    months to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as
    distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy.
  </li>
  <li>Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored, without any attempt to limit
    the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations. No other single act will serve as
    this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set and
    determined for the government of their relations with one another. Without this healing act the whole
    structure and validity of international law is forever impaired.
  </li>
  <li>All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to
    France by Prussia in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world
    for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the
    interest of all.
  </li>
  <li>A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of
    nationality.
  </li>
  <li>The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and
    assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity of autonomous development.
  </li>
  <li>Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated; occupied territories restored; Serbia
    accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relations of the several Balkan states to one another
    determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and
    international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the
    several Balkan states should be entered into.
  </li>
  <li>The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the
    other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life
    and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of an autonomous development, and the Dardanelles should
    be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international
    guarantees.
  </li>
  <li>An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by
    indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose
    political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international
    covenant.
  </li>
  <li>A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of
    affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states
    alike.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  In regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions of right we feel ourselves to be
  intimate partners of all the governments and peoples associated together against the Imperialists. We
  cannot be separated in interest or divided in purpose. We stand together until the end.
</p>
<p>For such arrangements and covenants we are willing to fight and to continue to fight until they are
  achieved; but only because we wish the right to prevail and desire a just and stable peace such as can be
  secured only by removing the chief provocations to war, which this program does not remove.
</p>
<p>
  We have no jealousy of German greatness, and there is nothing in this program that impairs it. We
  grudge her no achievement or distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise such as have made her
  record very bright and very enviable. We do not wish to injure her or to block in any way her legitimate
  influence or power.</p>
<p>
  We do not wish to fight her either with arms or with hostile arrangements of trade if she is willing to
  associate herself with us and the other peace-loving nations of the world in covenants of justice and law
  and fair dealing. We wish her only to accept a place of equality among the peoples of the world, - the
  new world in which we now live, - instead of a place of mastery.
</p>
<p>
  Neither do we presume to suggest to her any alteration or modification of her institutions. But it is
  necessary, we must frankly say, and necessary as a preliminary to any intelligent dealings with her on
  our part, that we should know whom her spokesmen speak for when they speak to us, whether for the
  Reichstag majority or for the military party and the men whose creed is imperial domination.
</p>
<p>
  We have spoken now, surely, in terms too concrete to admit of any further doubt or question. An
  evident principle runs through the whole program I have outlined. It is the principle of justice to all
  peoples and nationalities, and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another,
  whether they be strong or weak.
</p>
<p>
  Unless this principle be made its foundation no part of the structure of international justice can stand.
  The people of the United States could act upon no other principle; and to the vindication of this
  principle they are ready to devote their lives, their honour, and everything that they possess. The moral
  climax of this the culminating and final war for human liberty has come, and they are ready to put their
  own strength, their own highest purpose, their own integrity and devotion to the test.
