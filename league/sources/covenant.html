<h1>The Covenant of the League of Nations</h1>
<h4>(Including Amendments adopted to December, 1924)</h4>

<div class="article" id="1">
  <p>
    THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES, In order to promote international co-operation and to achieve
    international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war, by the
    prescription of open, just and honourable relations between nations, by the firm establishment of the

    understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among Governments, and by the
    maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organised
    peoples with one another,
  </p>

  <p>
    Agree to this Covenant of the League of Nations.
  </p>

  <h6>Article 1</h6>

  <p>
    The original Members of the League of Nations shall be those of the Signatories which are named in the
    Annex to this Covenant and also such of those other States named in the Annex as shall accede without
    reservation to this Covenant.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such accession shall be effected by a Declaration deposited with the Secretariat within two months of
    the coming into force of the Covenant. Notice thereof shall be sent to all other Members of the League.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any fully self-governing State, Dominion or Colony not named in the Annex may become a Member of
    the League if its admission is agreed to by two-thirds of the Assembly, provided that it shall give

    such regulations as may be prescribed by the League in regard to its military, naval and air forces and
    armaments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any Member of the League may, after two years&#39; notice of its intention so to do, withdraw from the

    on the Council.

    The Council shall meet from time to time as occasion may require, and at least once a year, at the Seat
    of the League, or at such other place as may be decided upon.
    The Council may deal at its meetings with any matter within the sphere of action of the League or
    affecting the peace of the world.

  <p>
    Any Member of the League not represented on the Council shall be invited to send a Representative to
    sit as a member at any meeting of the Council during the consideration of matters specially affecting the

  </p>

  <p>
    All matters of procedure at meetings of the Assembly or of the Council, including the appointment of
    Committees to investigate particular matters, shall be regulated by the Assembly or by the Council and

  </p>

  <p>
    The first meeting of the Assembly and the first meeting of the Council shall be summoned by the
    President of the United States of America.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="6">

    its meetings shall be inviolable.
  </p>

</div>

<div class="article" id="8">
  <h6>Article 8</h6>

  <p>
    The Members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national
    armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action
    of international obligations.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Council, taking account of the geographical situation and circumstances of each State, shall
    formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration and action of the several Governments. Such
    plans shall be subject to reconsideration and revision at least every ten years.
  </p>

  <p>
    After these plans shall have been adopted by the several Governments, the limits of armaments therein
    fixed shall not be exceeded without the concurrence of the Council.

  </p>

  <p>
    The Members of the League agree that the manufacture by private enterprise of munitions and
    implements of war is open to grave objections. The Council shall advise how the evil effects attendant
    upon such manufacture can be prevented, due regard being had to the necessities of those Members of
    the League which are not able to manufacture the munitions and implements of war necessary for their
    safety.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Members of the League undertake to interchange full and frank information as to the scale of their
    armaments, their military, naval and air programmes and the condition of such of their industries as are
    adaptable to war-like purposes.

  </p>

</div>

<div class="article" id="9">
  <h6>Article 9</h6>

  <p>
    A permanent Commission shall be constituted to advise the Council on the execution of the provisions
    of Articles 1 and 8 and on military, naval and air questions generally.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="10">
  <h6>Article 10</h6>

  <p>
    The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the
    territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any
    such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the
    means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="11">
  <h6>Article 11</h6>

  <p>
    Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is
    hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may
    be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations.
  </p>

  <p>
    In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of
    the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council. It is also declared to be the friendly right of
    each Member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance
    whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good
    understanding between nations upon which peace depends.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="12">
  <h6>Article 12</h6>

  <p>
    The Members of the League agree that, if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to
    a rupture they will submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the
    Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators
    or the judicial decision, or the report by the Council.
  </p>

  <p>
    In any case under this Article the award of the arbitrators or the judicial decision shall be made within a
    reasonable time, and the report of the Council shall be made within six months after the submission of
    the dispute.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="13">
  <h6>Article 13</h6>

  <p>
    The Members of the League agree that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they
    recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement and which cannot be
    satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they will submit the whole subject-matter to arbitration or judicial
    settlement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Disputes as to the interpretation of a treaty, as to any question of international law, as to the existence
    of any fact which if established would constitute a breach of any international obligation, or as to the
    extent and nature of the reparation to be made for any such breach, are declared to be among those
    which are generally suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the consideration of any such dispute, the court to which the case is referred shall be the Permanent
    Court of International Justice, established in accordance with Article 14, or any tribunal agreed on by the
    parties to the dispute or stipulated in any convention existing between them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award or decision that
    may be rendered, and that they will not resort to war against a Member of the League which complies
    therewith. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award or decision, the Council shall propose
    what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="14">
  <h6>Article 14</h6>

  <p>
    The Council shall formulate and submit to the Members of the League for adoption plans for the
    establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Court shall be competent to hear and determine any dispute of an international character which the
    parties thereto submit to it. The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question
    referred to it by the Council or by the Assembly.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="15">
  <h6>Article 15</h6>

  <p>
    If there should arise between Members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, which is
    not submitted to arbitration or judicial settlement in accordance with Article 13, the Members of the
    League agree that they will submit the matter to the Council.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any party to the dispute may effect such submission by giving notice of the existence of the dispute to
    the Secretary General, who will make all necessary arrangements for a full investigation and
    consideration thereof.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this purpose the parties to the dispute will communicate to the Secretary General, as promptly as
    possible, statements of their case with all the relevant facts and papers, and the Council may forthwith
    direct the publication thereof.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Council shall endeavour to effect a settlement of the dispute, and if such efforts are successful, a
    statement shall be made public giving such facts and explanations regarding the dispute and the terms
    of settlement thereof as the Council may deem appropriate.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the dispute is not thus settled, the Council either unanimously or by a majority vote shall make and
    publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are
    deemed just and proper in regard thereto.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any Member of the League represented on the Council may make public a statement of the facts of the
    dispute and of its conclusions regarding the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the
    Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League agree that
    they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the
    report.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than
    the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League reserve to
    themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right
    and justice.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the dispute between the parties is claimed by one of them, and is found by the Council, to arise out of
    a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the Council
    shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its settlement.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Council may in any case under this Article refer the dispute to the Assembly. The dispute shall be so
    referred at the request of either party to the dispute, provided that such request be made within
    fourteen days after the submission of the dispute to the Council.
  </p>

  <p>
    In any case referred to the Assembly, all the provisions of this Article and of Article 12 relating to the
    action and powers of the Council shall apply to the action and powers of the Assembly, provided that a
    report made by the Assembly, if concurred in by the Representatives of those Members of the League
    represented on the Council and of a majority of the other Members of the League, exclusive in each case
    of the Representatives of the parties to the dispute, shall have the same force as a report by the Council
    concurred in by all the members thereof other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to
    the dispute.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="16">
  <h6>Article 16</h6>

  <p>
    Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15,
    it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League,
    which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the
    prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State,
    and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the
    covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned
    what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the
    armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial
    and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and
    inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in
    resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that
    they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the
    Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any Member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may be declared to be no
    longer a Member of the League by a vote of the Council concurred in by the Representatives of all the
    other Members of the League represented thereon.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="17">
  <h6>Article 17</h6>

  <p>
    In the event of a dispute between a Member of the League and a State which is not a Member of the
    League, or between States not Members of the League, the State or States not Members of the League
    shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute,
    upon such conditions as the Council may deem just.
  </p>

  <p>
    If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of Articles 12 to 16 inclusive shall be applied with such
    modifications as may be deemed necessary by the Council. Upon such invitation being given the Council
    shall immediately institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute and recommend such action
    as may seem best and most effectual in the circumstances.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a State so invited shall refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes
    of such dispute, and shall resort to war against a Member of the League, the provisions of Article 16
    shall be applicable as against the State taking such action.
  </p>

  <p>
    If both parties to the dispute when so invited refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the
    League for the purposes of such dispute, the Council may take such measures and make such
    recommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the settlement of the dispute.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="18">
  <h6>Article 18</h6>

  <p>
    Every treaty or international engagement entered into hereafter by any Member of the League shall be
    forthwith registered with the Secretariat and shall as soon as possible be published by it. No such treaty
    or international engagement shall be binding until so registered.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="19">
  <h6>Article 19</h6>

  <p>
    The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties
    which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance
    might endanger the peace of the world.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="20">
  <h6>Article 20</h6>

  <p>
    The Members of the League severally agree that this Covenant is accepted as abrogating all obligations
    or understandings inter se which are inconsistent with the terms thereof, and solemnly undertake that
    they will not hereafter enter into any engagements inconsistent with the terms thereof.
  </p>

  <p>
    In case any Member of the League shall, before becoming a Member of the League, have undertaken
    any obligations inconsistent with the terms of this Covenant, it shall be the duty of such Member to take
    immediate steps to procure its release from such obligations.

  </p>

</div>

<div class="article" id="21">
  <h6>Article 21</h6>

  <p>
    Nothing in this Covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of international engagements, such as
    treaties of arbitration or regional understandings like the Monroe doctrine, for securing the
    maintenance of peace.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="22">
  <h6>Article 22</h6>

  <p>
    To those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the
    sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet
    able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be
    applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of
    civilisation and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in this Covenant.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be
    entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical
    position can best undertake this responsibility, and who are willing to accept it, and that this tutelage
    should be exercised by them as Mandatories on behalf of the League.
  </p>

  <p>
    The character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people, the
    geographical situation of the territory, its economic conditions and other similar circumstances.
  </p>

  <p>
    Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development
    where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering
    of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.
    The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other peoples, especially those of Central Africa, are at such a stage that the Mandatory must be
    responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of
    conscience and religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of
    abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic and the liquor traffic, and the prevention of the
    establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other
    than police purposes and the defence of territory, and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade
    and commerce of other Members of the League.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are territories, such as South-West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to
    the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of
    civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory, and other circumstances,
    can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to
    the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population.
  </p>

  <p>
    In every case of mandate, the Mandatory shall render to the Council an annual report in reference to
    the territory committed to its charge.
  </p>

  <p>
    The degree of authority, control, or administration to be exercised by the Mandatory shall, if not
    previously agreed upon by the Members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Council.
  </p>

  <p>
    A permanent Commission shall be constituted to receive and examine the annual reports of the
    Mandatories and to advise the Council on all matters relating to the observance of the mandates.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="23">
  <h6>Article 23</h6>

  <p>
    Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of international conventions existing or hereafter to be
    agreed upon, the Members of the League:
  </p>

  <p>
    will endeavour to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women, and
    children, both in their own countries and in all countries to which their commercial and industrial
    relations extend, and for that purpose will establish and maintain the necessary international
    organisations;
  </p>

  <p>
    undertake to secure just treatment of the native inhabitants of territories under their control;
  </p>

  <p>
    will entrust the League with the general supervision over the execution of agreements with regard to
    the traffic in women and children, and the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs;
  </p>

  <p>
    will entrust the League with the general supervision of the trade in arms and ammunition with the
    countries in which the control of this traffic is necessary in the common interest;
  </p>

  <p>
    will make provision to secure and maintain freedom of communications and of transit and equitable
    treatment for the commerce of all Members of the League. In this connection, the special necessities of
    the regions devastated during the war of 1914-1918 shall be borne in mind;
  </p>

  <p>
    will endeavour to take steps in matters of international concern for the prevention and control of
    disease.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="article" id="24">
  <h6>Article 24</h6>

  <p>
    There shall be placed under the direction of the League all international bureaux already established by
    general treaties if the parties to such treaties consent.
  </p>

  <p>
    All such international bureaux and all commissions for the regulation of matters of international interest
    hereafter constituted shall be placed under the direction of the League.
  </p>

  <p>
    In all matters of international interest which are regulated by general convention but which are not
    placed under the control of international bureaux or commissions, the Secretariat of the League shall,
    subject to the consent of the Council and if desired by the parties, collect and distribute all relevant
    information and shall render any other assistance which may be necessary or desirable.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Council may include as part of the expenses of the Secretariat the expenses of any bureau or
    commission which is placed under the direction of the League.
