<h1>The League Fight</h1>
<p>
  The tone of the Paris Peace Conference after WWI was one of retribution rather than reconciliation. But while the
  Allied Powers were busy redistributing newly won territories, Woodrow Wilson was working to incorporate the League of
  Nations and the rest of his blueprint for peace into the Treaty of Versailles.  He had to contend with those who
  preferred to leave the League up to discussion after the Treaty of Versailles was adopted by all parties. At a
  difficult point in the negotiations, Wilson had to make a brief visit to the United States. When he returned to Paris,
  he found that the treaty had been formulated to exclude the League altogether. Wilson’s advocacy never faltered when
  faced with opposition or even deteriorating health. He knew that in order for the League to be viable, it must be at
  the forefront of the treaty rather than serving as mere afterthought. Because of Wilson’s tireless effort, the first
  26 articles of the Treaty of Versailles formed <a href="sources/covenant.html">Covenant of the League</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The fight for the League, however, did not end with the victory in Paris. Wilson brought the treaty back home where it
  faced another around of trials on the floor of the Senate. Leading the opposition was
  <a href="sources/cabot.html">Senator Henry Cabot Lodge</a>, a staunch Republican who believed that the covenant
  amounted to a cession of sovereignty from the United States. He spoke out against the League, declaring:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>

    We have been devoted to the cause of freedom, humanity, and civilization everywhere. Now we
    are asked, in the making of peace, to sacrifice our sovereignty in important respects, to involve
    ourselves almost without limit in the affairs of other nations and to yield up policies and rights
    which we have maintained throughout our history.
  </p>

  <p>
    In what I have already said about other nations putting us into war I have covered one point of sovereignty which
    ought never to be yielded &mdash; the power to send American soldiers and sailors everywhere... We have not reached
    the great position from which we were able to come down into the field of battle and help to save the world from
    tyranny by being guided by others. Our vast power has all been built up and gathered together by ourselves alone.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Wilson was equally vocal in support of the League. He appealed to Congress, “Shall we or any other free people
  hesitate to accept this great duty? Dare we reject and break the heart of the world?” He appealed to the masses,
  embarking upon a tour of the nation to garner support for the League. Traveling 9,981 miles, Wilson gave speeches in
  29 cities for his vision of a new international order. In his last speech at Pueblo, Colorado on September 25th, 1919,
  Wilson affirmed the League of Nations as crucial step towards world peace:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    You will say, “Is the League and absolute guaranty against war?” No; I do not know any absolute guaranty against the
    errors of human judgment or the violence of human passion... I ask you this: If it is not an absolute insurance
    against war, do you want no insurance at all? Do you want nothing? Do you want not only no probability that war will
    not recur, but the probability that it will recur? The arrangements of justice of not stand of themselves, my fellow
    citizens. The arrangements of this treaty are just, but they need the support of the combined power of the great
    nations of the world.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Shortly after delivering these words in Pueblo, Colorado, President Wilson collapsed. He had worked himself to
  exhaustion while fighting for his cause. Disregarding his own health, Wilson refused to stand by and allow the
  atrocities of WWI to recur. He later suffered a stroke that paralyzed half of his body and isolated him for the rest
  of his presidency.
</p>
<p>
  Despite Wilson’s relentless efforts, “the heart of the world” was eventually broken. The League of Nations faced its
  final test in March 1920. Lodge had a resolution on the floor which added 14 reservations to the Covenant. Wilson
  <a href="sources/wilson_refused.html">flatly refused</a> Lodge’s modifications, believing that they were “really
  camouflage and really results in the nullification of the treaty.” However, Lodge and his fellow Republicans held the
  majority in the Senate, and when it became evident that the Lodge Resolution would pass, Wilson instructed his
  supporters to vote against ratification. The treaty failed by seven votes.
