      <h1>Statement by Paderewski on the League of Nations</h1>
<h4>18 September 1919</h4>
<p>
  From a Polish point of view, our one hope of future security as a State lies in the League of Nations.
  Upon it, and I fear upon it alone, depend the liberty of the Polish people and the successful
  development of democratic and liberal government in Poland.
</p>
<p>
  Standing, as we are, between Germany on one side and Russia on the other, we cannot hope to
  maintain our integrity during these years, while we build up the strength of our people, unless we have
  the protection of the League.
</p>
<p>
  Poland at the present moment has 500,000 men under arms. Our people are short of food supplies,
  short of clothing, short of many of the necessaries of life. We are compelled to make every sacrifice to
  sustain the army, and this, with our population needing its resources for the up-building of the nation, in
  order that we may protect ourselves from encroachment.
</p>
<p>
  Today we are defending 1,500 miles of front against Bolshevist forces, and in so doing, we stand as the
  front line in Europe against Bolshevist invasion from the east.
</p>
<p>
  We are endeavouring to maintain this front line and at the same time to achieve an economic stability,
  to recuperate our people from the effects of repeated invasions of German and Russian armies. The
  task is a terrible one. The tax upon our strength will be too great unless we can have the assurance that
  there will be a body in the world to whom we can appeal for aid in the righting of our wrongs.
</p>
<p>
  Poland has set up a democracy under the inspiration of the American people. Had it not been for
  American intervention in Europe we might possibly have had some semblance of independent
  Government under an autocratic overrule, but with American intervention and American help we have
  sought to establish not only the independence of the State, but also the internal liberty of our people,
  through the difficult road of democracy.
</p>
<p>
  The pressure is upon us on all sides through military action and through Bolshevist propaganda and an
  intense propaganda from Germany. Unless we have a protective power in the world, under whose
  strength we can secure an opportunity for peaceful development and the solution of our internal
  problems, free from distracting and antagonistic influences, I fear for the safety of our democracy.
</p>
<p>
  The great power and the support which it may furnish need not be military, its moral and economic
  force is all that we ask, and that power is the League of Nations.
