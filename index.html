          <p>
            My name is Alex Crichton, and I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon
            University earning a Bachelor's degree in both Computer Science and
            Electrical and Computer Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently a TA for 15-410, Operating Systems, and plan on
            becoming a TA for 15-411, Compilers. I've worked for Facebook and
            Google, and will work with Mozilla this summer on the JS team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work on many side projects outside my classes, and some of them
            are described on this site. More information about me can be found
            via my email or resume:

            <a href='https://github.com/robbiemc/joule'>Joule</a> is an
            LLVM-based JIT for Lua. Developed with a friend of mine, this was an
            independent-study project for CMU.
          </p>

          <p>
            Developed from the ground-up, joule performs optimizations based
            on runtime-information, as well as using LLVM's built-in
            optimizations. Joule outperforms the default lua interpreter
            on most benchmarks.

            <a href='http://alexcrichton.com/jba/'>JBA</a> is a javascript
            gameboy written from scratch. It was implemented as a side project
            that I was interested in, and turned out quite well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current emulator supports original Gameboy games and Gameboy
            color games. I plan on looking into getting sound to work with the
            new APIs available at some point.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project enabled me to work with fun new HTML5 technologies like
            the canvas, local storage, and opening local files. The nitty-gritty
            can be found with the
            <a href='https://github.com/alexcrichton/jba'>source code</a>.

            newspaper, and I am currently their Systems Manager. This means

            The side is implemented in Rails and runs on our own Xen-powered
            virtualization. Our other VM images serve as a file server, mail
            servers, and various other web servers.
